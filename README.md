# Active to Passive Voice

There is a pickle file - participles.pickle which contains list of irregular verbs.  
act_pas.py contains a function active_to_passive which takes a sentence as input and gives its passive voice as output.  
The code depends on case analysis.
Every sentence is converted to its assertive form by reordering and then the output of reordered sentence is converted back to suit the original input.  
There are many more cases like - imperative sentences, etc which haven't been handled.  
I hope you like the code.
